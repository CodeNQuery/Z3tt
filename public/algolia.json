Invited by RStudio (now named Posit), I developed a new course that covers the most important steps and helpful tips to create visually appealing, engaging and complex graphics with ggplot2. The course focused on the main concepts of the grammar of graphics and used hands-on examples to explore ggplot2’s utility to create multi-layered, more complex graphs.","tags":["DataViz","ggplot2","rstats","workshop","tutorial"],"title":"2-Day Workshop on \"Graphic Design with ggplot2\" at rstudio::conf
